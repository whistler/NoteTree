NoteTree is a web based tool to keep notes in an hierarchy. It is still an 
alpha version. In future I plan to have wiki like syntax for taking notes
and MultiUser support. 

It is meant to be used like a personal wiki or in some cases like Evernote.

I need help with this project, feel free to submit changes or create more issues.
